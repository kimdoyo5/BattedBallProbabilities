### To-Do
[] Write pseudocode  
[] Implement pseudocode  
[] Analyze performance (compare against sample mean, softmax, GAM, xgboost, neural network)  
[] Write paper   

### Pseudocode

#### Overview
==Note: we could possibly use linear interpolation for smoothing instead of pseudolabels—use relative distances from query x==  
==(Problem with this is that the pseudolabling makes query time close to O(1) but above makes query time O(ND)==  
==Note: what if we include density data for calculating probabilities? So general Pr(input), some values of launch_angle/launch_speed are more likely—in more dense areas==
